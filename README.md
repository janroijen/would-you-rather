## Would you rather

This is an implementation of the 'Would you rather' project in Udacity's React course.
To run this project:
* Install dependencies with `npm install` and
* Start the development server with `npm start` (by default the server runs listens at localhost:3000)

## Description of the project
This description is taken from Udacity's course material:

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
